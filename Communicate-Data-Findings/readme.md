## Summary of Findings

> The majority of people who go out on a bike trip are subscribers, not customers. Yet customers spend more time on trip than subscribers.

> The majority of riders are male then female, last is others. Yet the order reverses when others spend the most time on the trip.

> People tend to bike-ride in the morning at 8-9AM, and 17PM in the afternoon.

> Weekends are the time people ride the longest.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> I find out that genders do not affect the amount of time a person will be riding. 

> Most people are subscribers for the company, but spend less time than customers. This may due to the fact they have been regularly riding while customers may be taking on the trip for 1 or 2 times during February.
